Project Space Bois:

In the year 199X, you are the captain of the S.S. Bumpkin, fighting against enemy aliens.

You have main attacks: Missiles and Big Guns. Missiles is very weak, dealing about 5 damage, but it never misses. Big guns does 25 damage, but misses 50% of the time.

You have 10 repair tools, which are used to completely restore your HP. When you use one, it will break, so use them wisely.

If you run out of health, you lose the game, and the enemies get stronger. Don't worry, you get more HP as you progress.

Every time you attack, the enemy does as well, randomly deciding which attack to use. Be careful, some of them have very strong attacks.


There are a few secrets hidden as well. Who knows? Maybe finding both of them unlocks a third.
    Hint 1: Try some star gazing
    Hint 2: spelling is hard sometimes
    Hint 3: Your cursor is a traitor
